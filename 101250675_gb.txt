George Brown College offers a wide variety of programs, from Computer Technician to
Fashion Design. The Casa Loma campus has two Tim Hortans, one inside the dining hall
and another on Davenport road. The one outside of campus is the better one.

There is also a St.James campus that offers an incredibly indepth culinary course.

The waterfront campus has to be one of the most visually pleasing by far.
