DevOps is an important approach used in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It connects the development and operations teams to improve collaboration and efficiency. In traditional SDLC, development and deployment were separate processes, which caused delays. DevOps integrates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) into every stage of the SDLC. It supports faster development, testing, and release of software. Automation tools are used to reduce manual work and human errors. DevOps also focuses on monitoring and feedback after deployment. This helps teams quickly fix bugs and improve performance. By using DevOps in SDLC, organizations can deliver high-quality software more quickly and reliably.

DevOps in SDLC:
DevOps plays an important role in every stage of the Software Development Life Cycle.
During planning, it ensures clear communication between teams.
During development, version control improves collaboration and code management.
