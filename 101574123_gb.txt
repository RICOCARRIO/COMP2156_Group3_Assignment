George Brown College

George Brown College is located in Toronto and focuses on hands-on learning. Programs are designed with industry partners so students obtain real job skills.

The college offers technology programs like networking and programming. Students are able to practice doing labs and projects instead of only theory.

Because it is downtown, students are able to get exposure to companies and potential networking opportunities.

A lot of classes also include group work which helps with communication skills.

Some things I like about the school:
- Hands-on labs
- Helpful teachers
- Provides online education for working students
