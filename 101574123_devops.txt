DevOps Course

DevOps combines software development and IT operations. It helps teams release software faster and more reliably.

In DevOps we learn about Git, branching, collaboration and automation. CI/CD pipelines automatically test and deploy code.

It also makes it easier to work as a team because everyone follows the same steps.

This helps reduce errors and makes teamwork smoother
